Used Car Price Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the selling price of a used car based on various features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.

The goal is to assist sellers and buyers in understanding the fair market value of a vehicle, enabling better pricing decisions.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and relationships between car features and price.

Model Training: Various regression algorithms are tested, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Extra Tree Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor
